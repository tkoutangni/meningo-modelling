# this is a function which, given a value of S, C, I and R at time t
# calculates the time derivatives dS/dt; dC/dt; dI/dt et dR/dt of S C I and R
# vparameters is a vector/list containing the parameters of the model, like the
# recovery period (gamma), and the baseline transmission rate (beta0),
# the day of the year when transmission is maximal (teta) when seasonal forcing 
# function explitely include teta,the relative
# the degree of seasonal forcing (epsilon), the baseline disease invasion rate a0 etc...
#
# Unlike the unforced SCIRS model, the harmonic forcing of the transmission
# rate and the disease invasion rate makes this set of ODE's non-autonomous.  
# This means that the results of the model will depend on the time of introduction 
# of the meningococcus (new pathogenic strain for examplz), relative to the day of the 
# year when transmission is maximal!
#
# This function gets passed to the ODEsolve package
# Model assumes immunity from both assymptomatic carriage and disease.But it is still
# unclear whether carriers transmit the disease more than disease.Eventhough it is quite
# intuitive that diseased would transmit less than assymptomatic carriers due to disease
# severity (patient are bound to bed and thus are likely to transmit less). This is not explicitely 
# incorporated in the model.
