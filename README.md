# Mathematical modelling of meningitis epidemics in Africa

Mathematical modelling of bacterial meningitis transmission and disease in Africa. A work i have developed to help further understanding of meningitis epidemics dynamics in Africa, providing an adapted modeling framework for evaluating meningitis vaccination impact. The program was developed in R.

A paper describing the work and preliminary results is published in a peer reviewed journal and can be found [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/compartmental-models-for-seasonal-hyperendemic-bacterial-meningitis-in-the-african-meningitis-belt/3A511F9A1E04935A99FB237B37C32104)

More details on the project will be provided soon on this page.
